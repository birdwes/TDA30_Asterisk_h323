Reproduced from ETSI ES 201-235-1

Tones shall meet the following criteria (from SIN 351 Para 4.1)

·     combinations of the frequencies given in the table where the tolerance is within +/- 1.5 % and the level is within -7 dBm to -13 dBm and with the high frequency at a higher level than the low frequency by between 1 dB and 4 dB, and 

·     tones that have been applied for a minimum period of 40 ms and with a minimum "tone off" period of 40 ms, and 

·     the level of any individual unwanted tone in the frequency band 300 Hz to 3,400 Hz has a power level of less than -33 dBm, and 

·     tones whose accompanying power level outside the frequency band 300 Hz to 3,400 Hz is less than -40 dBm, and 

·     tones whose accompanying total in-audio-band and out-audio-band unwanted tone power levels are 20 dB less than the lowest power level of any single digit tone.
